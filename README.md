Hi I made this project during the Android Development COMPOSE CAMP, conducted by <b> GDSC
</b>.
The facilitator during the session was Mr. Raj Narayan Mishra. I got to
learn a lot during these days and it was an amazing experience learning with GDSC.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to attend the pathways as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>UI design
<li>APP Artitecture
<li>Navigation
<br>during these days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these days, you can as well.
